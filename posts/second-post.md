The Pomodoro Technique has been quite a discovery for the busy folks. The only problem with many tools based on this technique is that they lack flexibility. Like, giving you the option to listen to the favorite music while taking a break. Or take a shorter break. Or get distracted when you’re stuck on a task. The fun activities that still keep you focused on work. We believe we’ve found what it takes, though. 

## Cleverly schedule your breaks with Time Out app 

Sitting in front of a computer for long periods of time makes you slouch and hinders your productivity. Time Out is a tool that can fix it through smart breaks. The app comes with customizable time out periods you can integrate into your workflow. Go with defaults and there’s no chance you’ll experience neck strains or back problems, because of sitting in front of your Mac. Feel like there’s space for improving the breaks? Time Out caters for that, too. 

## Take a break, your own way

Time out comes with two types of breaks — a “normal” 10-minute break that you take every hour and “mini” 15-second breaks for every 15 minutes. Mini breaks are not very common in Pomodoro tools, yet they are super helpful when it comes to moving your focus from one task to another. 

Nothing carved in stone, though. You can change everything about your time-out periods if you like. Disable mini breaks, add your custom ones, change the timing, set the breaks to count backwards — the options are limitless. 

Time Out also has a collection of themes that show up when your break starts. You can choose the one you like, or create your own — most of the themes are based on common web standards like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
