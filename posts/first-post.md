Where would we be in life without alarms? Alarms get us to work on time, to the airport on time, to church on time; they stop us missing deadlines and birthdays and remind us to take our medication when we need it. They're useful for everything.

On Mac, you can set alarms for tasks, events, meetings, and just about anything else that would require an alert. In this article, we'll show you how to set an alarm clock on Mac with the help of the Apple Calendar and some useful apps.
## How to set an alarm on Mac with the Apple Calendar
 
 The Apple Calendar is the place for all things schedule-related, including alarms. To set a one-time alarm, you have to first create an event.
 
 Click on the Launchpad, then click on the Calendar app.
 Double-click the date that you want to set the alarm on.
 Right-click your preferred time slot and select New Event.
 Enter the name for your event, then click on the date and time section.
 Enter the time that you want the alarm to go off, then click on None next to alert.
 In the pop-up menu click Custom…, then Message. Click on Message with sound and choose an alarm chime.  
 Select how many minutes before the event you want the alarm to go off, then click OK.
 Any alarm that you set in your Mac Calendar app with automatically sync with your iPhone or iPad, so if you’re away from your computer you will still receive the alert.
 ## Server-side Rendering
 is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
